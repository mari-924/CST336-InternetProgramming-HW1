    <p id="explanation">Gesture and Pose Recognition plays an important role in many different fields. It is used in things like
        human-machine interaction, beahavior analysis, surveillence videos, motion capture, etc. Real time recognition of different 
        hand gestures, basic and complex, is possible. Which allows users to interact with technologies without needing to touch it.
        The computer will detect that there is a hand, and based on something called hand geomettry, the computer
        will figure out and recognize what that gesture means.
