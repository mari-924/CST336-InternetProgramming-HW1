    <p id="explanation">Computer vision is a field within computer science. it focuses on
        getting computers to not just identify but also to understand objects
        and people in both images and videos. Computer Vision is a form of AI that
        wants to do and automate tasks that would replicate human capabilities. Computer
        Vision hopes to replicate not just the way humans see but also to be able to make
        sense of what they see. Computer Vision is part of lots of different technology,
        which makes it an important component to modern innovations and solutions.
