    <p id="explanation"> Facial Recognition is a way to be able to identify or confirm an
        identification of someone by using a picture of their face. These type of systems can
        be used to identify someone in real time or even identify someone in a picture or video.
        This type of system can be a quick and efficient way for verification, as it is faster
        and more convenient compated to other types of biometric technologies. It can also be more
        accurate way to identify someone rather than just using their email, address, or IP. These systems
        are used in many different things including fraud detection, banking, healthcare, cybersecurity, etc.
